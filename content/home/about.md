# Biography

I am a third year Undergraduate, majoring Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. I am seriously not interested in any of the courses (>\_<) I just wish to get out of this fu**in college life and start my small own buisness (tea stall ? suggestions are welcome).

My hobbies include skating, Ultimate (frisbee) and I am a big fan of classical Indian instrumental music (no, I don't how to play any :-).
